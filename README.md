# A-predict-and-optimize-approach-to-profit-driven-churn-prevention
Open-access implementation of the paper "A predict-and-optimize approach to profit-driven churn prevention".

To run the model comparisons it is necessary to have the implementation of "Profit maximizing logistic model for customer churn prediction using genetic algorithms" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210650216301754) code from https://github.com/estripling/proflogit.
This repository also includes a self-made implementation of the multisegment approach in the paper "Profit-driven churn prediction for the mutual fund industry: A multisegment approach" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305048320307349?casa_token=qJ4BgTwdEacAAAAA:Yo1GIP3Kx7VjA1ObhOSAvgW4BH8BO6ZHxw3kCnQScMaI8ViWoHA17GtzgH0_PTOPwbx0st8I).
